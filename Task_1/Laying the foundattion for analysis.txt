Defining the Data Analysis Workflow
1.1 Outline Analysis Steps:
Phase 1: Data Preparation & Exploration

Load historical Brent oil price data (CSV format)

Convert Date column to datetime format

Handle missing values and data quality checks

Perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Phase 2: Time Series Analysis
5. Analyze trends using moving averages
6. Test stationarity using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
7. Examine volatility patterns and clustering
8. Compute log returns: log(price_t) - log(price_{t-1})

Phase 3: Event Research & Dataset Creation
9. Research major geopolitical and economic events (2012-2022)
10. Compile structured event dataset with:
- Event name
- Event date (start)
- Event type (Political, Economic, OPEC, Conflict)
- Brief description
- Expected impact direction

Phase 4: Bayesian Change Point Modeling
11. Implement Bayesian change point detection using PyMC
12. Define prior distributions for parameters
13. Run MCMC sampling (NUTS algorithm)
14. Check convergence diagnostics (R-hat, trace plots)

Phase 5: Interpretation & Association
15. Extract posterior distributions of change points
16. Compare detected change points with historical events
17. Quantify price impacts before/after change points
18. Formulate causal hypotheses

Phase 6: Dashboard Development
19. Build Flask backend API with endpoints
20. Develop React frontend with interactive visualizations
21. Implement filtering and highlighting features
22. Test responsiveness across devices

Phase 7: Reporting & Communication
23. Create comprehensive analysis report
24. Document assumptions and limitations
25. Prepare presentation for stakeholders

1.2 Research and Compile Event Data:

Events Dataset Structure:

1.3 State Assumptions and Limitations:
Key Assumptions:

Brent oil prices reflect global market conditions accurately

Change points represent abrupt structural breaks in price dynamics

Major geopolitical/economic events have immediate price impacts

The single change point model is sufficient for initial analysis

Daily closing prices adequately capture market movements

Critical Limitations:

Correlation vs. Causation: Detected change points may coincide with events but don't prove causation

Omitted Variables: Model doesn't account for other factors (USD strength, inflation, alternative energy)

Time Lag Effects: Some events may have delayed impacts not captured

Model Simplicity: Single change point model may miss multiple or gradual changes

Data Frequency: Daily data may miss intraday volatility events

Communication Channels:

Primary: Interactive React dashboard

Secondary: PDF report (suitable for policymakers)

Supporting: GitHub repository with code and documentation

Presentation: Live demo to stakeholders via video conference
